Fish Key Point Detection in Underwater Images
Overview
Detecting fish key points from underwater images captured in real-time pond environments is crucial for supporting intelligent aquaculture systems in fish identification and biomass estimation. In today's maritime era, aquaculture stands as a cornerstone of our nation's economic vitality. Fish biomass estimation poses a significant challenge for the aquaculture industry, necessitating the development of smart, intelligent systems to automate fish mass estimation.

Fish key point detection serves as the initial step for fish biomass estimation in intelligent systems. It involves identifying and localizing specific anatomical landmarks or key points on fish bodies, such as the eye, dorsal fin, anal fin, and tail. However, this task is challenging due to the complex underwater environment, which includes varying lighting conditions, water turbidity, fish occlusions, and diverse fish species.

Objective
The objective of this challenge is to develop robust computer vision algorithms capable of accurately detecting fish key points in underwater images captured in wild environments. Key points provide valuable information about fish biomass, behavior, health, and growth, facilitating disease detection, feeding optimization, and overall aquaculture management.

Approach
The proposed solution utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.0005. The activation function used is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Alignment
Improving the efficiency and efficacy of aquaculture monitoring directly aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), which focuses on conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources.
